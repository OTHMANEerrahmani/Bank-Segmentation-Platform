### 2. Upload Sample Data

The app includes a pre-generated sample dataset at:

assets/bank_customers.csv


This file contains:
- **200 customer records**
- **6 features**: Monthly Income, Savings Amount, Credit Balance, Card Spending, Age, Bank Seniority

---

### 3. Complete Analysis Workflow

#### Step 1: Upload CSV File
1. Go to **Home** page
2. Drag and drop `bank_customers.csv` or click to browse
3. Click **"Start Cleaning"**

#### Step 2: Review Data Cleaning Results
- View cleaning metrics: rows processed, missing values handled, outliers corrected
- Download cleaning log for audit trail
- Click **"Run PCA Analysis"**

#### Step 3: Analyze PCA Results
- View explained variance chart (how much information each component captures)
- Examine customer distribution scatter plot (PC1 vs PC2)
- Review component contributions table
- Click **"Go to Clustering"**

#### Step 4: Run Clustering
1. Click **"Compute Elbow Method"** to see optimal k recommendation
2. Review elbow plot and silhouette scores
3. Select number of clusters (recommended: k=3 for sample data)
4. Click **"Run K-Means with k=3"**
5. View colored scatter plot showing cluster assignments
6. Click **"View Customer Profiles"**

#### Step 5: Explore Customer Profiles
- Review detailed statistics for each segment
- Filter by specific clusters
- Download cluster summary CSV
- Click **"Generate Marketing Insights"**

#### Step 6: View Marketing Insights
- Review segment distribution pie chart
- Explore insight cards with:
  - Segment names (e.g., "Premium Savers", "Young Professionals")
  - Top 3 KPIs per segment
  - 3-5 marketing recommendations per segment
- Download full insights report

### 4. Expected Results (with sample data)

You should see **3 distinct customer segments**:

**Segment 1: Loyal Veterans / Diligent Savers**
- Higher savings amounts
- Older age range
- Longer bank seniority
- Recommendations: Loyalty rewards, retirement planning

**Segment 2: Young Professionals / Standard Customers**
- Moderate income and savings
- Younger age range
- Lower bank seniority
- Recommendations: Digital banking, starter products

**Segment 3: High-Income Earners / Active Spenders**
- Higher monthly income
- Higher card spending
- Mixed age range
- Recommendations: Premium cards, investment products

---

### 5. Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Upload fails
- **Solution**: Ensure CSV has the 6 required columns with exact names (including â‚¬ symbol)

**Problem**: Cleaning takes too long
- **Solution**: Sample data should process in 1-2 seconds. Check file size (max 5MB)

**Problem**: Charts not displaying
- **Solution**: Ensure each step completes before moving to next (check "Stage" indicator in top-right)

**Problem**: Empty pages
- **Solution**: Follow the workflow in order: Upload â†’ Clean â†’ PCA â†’ Cluster â†’ Profiles â†’ Insights

---

### 6. Custom Data Requirements

To use your own data, ensure your CSV has these **exact column names**:


Monthly Income (â‚¬),Savings Amount (â‚¬),Credit Balance (â‚¬),Monthly Card Spending (â‚¬),Age,Bank Seniority (years)


**Data Format**:
- Numeric values only (no currency symbols in cells)
- Age: whole numbers (22-70)
- Seniority: whole numbers (1-25)
- Missing values: OK (pipeline will handle)
- Outliers: OK (pipeline will cap at 3 std devs)
