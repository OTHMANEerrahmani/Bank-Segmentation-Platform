# Client-Segment: Bank Customer Segmentation Platform

## Project Overview
Full-stack Reflex app for bank customer segmentation using PCA and clustering with interactive dashboards and marketing insights.

---

## Phase 1: Core Architecture & Data Upload ✅
- [x] Set up modular project structure (state.py, components/, utils/, pages/)
- [x] Create AppState with all required variables (raw_data, cleaned_data, pca_data, clustered_data, profiles, insights, cleaning_log, current_stage)
- [x] Implement CSV upload functionality with file handling
- [x] Build main app layout with sidebar navigation (icons + labels)
- [x] Create reusable component library (navbar, card, charts, datatable)
- [x] Set up routing for all pages: Data Cleaning, PCA Analysis, Clustering, Customer Profiles, Insights

---

## Phase 2: Data Cleaning Pipeline & PCA Analysis ✅
- [x] Implement 4-step cleaning pipeline (Control → Diagnose → Treat → Report)
- [x] Create data_cleaning.py page with upload interface and cleaning metrics display
- [x] Build cleaning_pipeline.py utility with missing value detection, outlier detection, duplicate removal
- [x] Generate downloadable cleaning log CSV
- [x] Implement PCA analysis in pca_utils.py (standardization, PCA computation, variance analysis)
- [x] Create pca_analysis.py page with explained variance charts, scree plot, component contributions
- [x] Display PCA scatter plot (first 2 components) with interactive visualization
- [x] Store cleaned and PCA-transformed data in state

---

## Phase 3: Clustering & Customer Profiling ✅
- [x] Implement K-Means clustering in clustering_utils.py with elbow method
- [x] Create clustering.py page with cluster number selection (2-10)
- [x] Display silhouette score and elbow plot for optimal cluster selection
- [x] Visualize clusters on PCA space with color-coded scatter plot
- [x] Build customer_profiles.py page with cluster statistics cards
- [x] Display mean values per cluster (income, savings, spending, credit, age, seniority)
- [x] Add filters by cluster and downloadable cluster summary CSV
- [x] Create profile comparison visualizations (radar charts, bar charts)

---

## Phase 4: Insights & Marketing Recommendations ✅
- [x] Implement insights_utils.py for generating segment-specific recommendations
- [x] Create insights.py page with KPI dashboard
- [x] Display cluster distribution pie chart and size metrics
- [x] Generate top 3 KPIs per segment with visual indicators
- [x] Create marketing recommendation cards per cluster (upsell, retention, engagement strategies)
- [x] Add interactive charts: radar chart (segment comparison), stacked bar (distribution)
- [x] Implement export functionality (CSV and PDF summary reports)
- [x] Add success animations and visual feedback for completed analysis
